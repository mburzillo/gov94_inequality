## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import data}
raw_codebook <- read.csv("code_book_raw_1940.csv")

#first <- read.csv("usa_00029.csv")

second <- read.csv("usa_00030.csv")

#third <- read.csv("usa_00031.csv")

#fourth <- read.csv("usa_00032.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r clean raw codebook, echo=FALSE}

codebook_city_1940 <- raw_codebook %>%
  separate(city, c("city", "state"), ",") %>%
  
```


```{r take only relevant cities from big file}

redlined_mayor_cities_unite <-  redlined_mayor_cities %>%
  unite("cityst", cityname, state, sep = ", ")

codebook_mayor_cities <- left_join(redlined_mayor_cities_unite, raw_codebook, by = c("cityst" = "city"))

first_join <- left_join(first, codebook_mayor_cities, by = c("CITY" = "code")) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

write.csv(first_join, "first_join.csv")

first_join_sub <- first_join %>%filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

first_join_sub %>% mutate(count = 1) %>% group_by(CITY, cityst) %>% summarize(tot = sum(count))
```

```{r fourth, include = FALSE}
fourth_join <- left_join(fourth, codebook_mayor_cities, by = c("CITY" = "code"))  %>% filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

fourth_join_sub <- fourth_join %>% filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

fourth_join_sub %>% mutate(count = 1) %>% group_by(CITY, cityst) %>% summarize(tot = sum(count))


write.csv(fourth_join, "fourth_join.csv")
```


```{r}
third_join <- left_join(third, codebook_mayor_cities, by = c("CITY" = "code")) %>% filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

third_join_sub <- third_join %>% filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

third_join_sub %>% mutate(count = 1) %>% group_by(CITY, cityst) %>% summarize(tot = sum(count))


write.csv(third_join, "third_join.csv")
```


```{r}
second_join <- left_join(second, codebook_mayor_cities, by = c("CITY" = "code")) %>% filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

second_join_sub <- second_join %>% filter(!(is.na(cityst)))

second_join_sub %>% mutate(count = 1) %>% group_by(CITY, cityst) %>% summarize(tot = sum(count))

write.csv(second_join, "second_join.csv")

nrow(second_join)
```
